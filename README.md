# Placebo
Placebo is a light-weight RimWorld mod that seeks to add in small patches to help improve performance in areas that don't get covered by bigger performance mods

Originally designed as a meme mod in the face of an increasing amount of AI-coded performance mods - often called AI slop or vibe-coded slop - Placebo has since transformed itself into a true performance mod that helps deal with mothballing issues regarding pawns and hopefully other small additions in the near future
